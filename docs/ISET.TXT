The following assembler directives are supported

.data                 - start of data segment
.text                 - start of code segment
.code                 - start of code segment (same as .text)  
.org    <n>           - start address
.space  <n>           - leave n empty bytes
.asciiz <s>           - enters zero terminated ascii string
.ascii  <s>           - enter ascii string
.align  <n>           - align to n-byte boundary
.word   <n1>,<n2>..   - enters word(s) of data (64-bits)
.byte   <n1>,<n2>..   - enter bytes
.word32 <n1>,<n2>..   - enters 32 bit number(s)
.word16 <n1>,<n2>..   - enters 16 bit number(s)
.double <n1>,<n2>..   - enters floating-point number(s)

where <n> denotes a number like 24, <s> denotes a string like "fred", and
<n1>,<n2>.. denotes numbers seperated by commas. 

The integer registers can be referred to as r0-r31, or R0-R31, or $0-$31 or using standard
MIPS pseudo-names, like $zero for r0, $t0 for r8 etc.

Floating point registers can be referred to as f0-f31, or F0-F31
